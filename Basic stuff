When we choose Android view We can see Gradle and App.
Gradle: Open source build tool that android studio uses to build app from the files in app folder.
the app folder contains : manifests - has android manifests file . it contains basic things about app.
                          res: we put icons, music to be used in the app.
                               res has activity_main.xml in layoout folder which shows us the how the app looks like
                          java:has mainactivity where main code in written.
                          mainactivity has package name and imported classes :
                          AppCompatActivity: compat is for compatibility ,this makes sure our app is backward compatible.
                          Bundle: which will make us use android OS.1
                          
      
160dp =1 inch.
sp = scale independent pixel.  same as dp but also affected by user stting for text zoom level.
dp= density independent pixels.

General idea is to use dp for everything except for texts for which we use sp.
TEXT View : width : width of the text view.
                 margins
                 style: how text looks inside the text view.
                 alpha: make the text view transparent.
                 background: background for our text.
                 fontfamily: to choose a font.
                 Gravity: alignment within the element. like we could gravitate the text 
                          to right or left.
                 padding : similar to margin but it is within the element.
                 textcolor.
                 
Button: onClick: what happends when button is clicked.
                  e.g we can enter clickFunction in the onClick field and then define the function in out 
                  java file.
                  Now in our java file. MainActiity.java we have MainActivity class which
                  is extending the AppCompatctivity class, onCreate it would load the savedInstanceState
                  if there is any on users phone.
                  SetContentView(R.layout.actity_main) sets the contenet veiw. R is for res , layout is for layout fodlder
                  it linked the maiin activity  with our ui.
                  
                  Button is a view and we are using clickFunnction by clicking on a view i,e button.
                  public void clickFunciton(View view)
                  {
                    Log.i("Info: ", " Button Pressed" );
                  }
                  lets say we want htis button to display some log information to us.
                  
TextField/ Plain Text hint: to show what is to be entered. eg. enter your name. lets say id for this is textID.
                            EditText myTextField= findViewById(textID);
                            but we dont want view by id we want EditText so we cast it.
                            EditText myTextField= (EditText)findViewById(textID);
                            and we wan to print this in the logs. so 
                  public void clickFunciton(View view)
                  {
                    EditText mytext=(EditText) findViewById(textID);
                    Log.i(" Info: "," mytext.getText().toString());
                  }
